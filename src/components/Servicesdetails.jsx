                  Verified Pools - These pools will contain the most popular and
                  in- demand assets, as determined by the Haawks team. Users
                  will be able to stake their liquidity provider (LP) tokens to
                  earn farming incentives in Haawks tokens, which can offset
                  impermanent loss as well as provide increased rewards.

                  Partner Pools - These pools will also be verified, but may
                  contain assets from new or recently launched projects. Once
                  verified by the Haawks team, these projects will have the
                  opportunity to partner with Haawks and launch exclusive pools
                  with dual rewards in both Haawks and Partner tokens.

                  allowing any community member to create them with any assets
                  and set the target price by providing initial liquidity.
                  However, these pools will be considered very risky and will

                  Verified and Partner pools are eligible for Liquidity Farming.
                  Upon providing liquidity to a specific pool, users contribute
                  an equal ratio of assets. By staking their LPs, they can earn
                  Farming rewards. However, the price fluctuations of one or
                  both assets may lead to impermanent loss. This occurs when one
                  asset's price in a pool moves higher or lower compared to the
                  other asset. The pool automatically rebalances both assets to
                  a 1:1 ratio periodically, resulting in fewer tokens in one
                  asset and more tokens in another asset when withdrawing pool
                  assets. We are trying to mitigate the risk of impermanent loss
                  by offering Farming incentives to attract users to provide
                  liquidity for our pools. The more liquidity we have for a
                  pool, the lower the slippage will be during the transaction.

                  indices. One of the key features of the platform is the
                  ability to go long or short with 10x leverage, which allows
                  traders to increase their exposure to the market and
                  potentially earn greater profits. Going long means buying an
                  asset in the hopes that its value will increase while going
                  short means selling an asset in the hopes that its value will
                  decrease. The ability to go both long and short provides
                  traders with more flexibility and allows them to profit
                  regardless of market conditions. With 10x leverage, traders
                  can invest a smaller amount of capital and still see
                  significant returns, but it is important to note that leverage
                  also magnifies losses, so traders must be careful when using

                  amplify their returns by borrowing money from the broker. The
                  amount of leverage that a trader can access depends on their
                  account's margin requirements. If a trader has a margin

                  pool of funds to draw from. This reduces the risk of

                Asset Tokenisation of Real Estate
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li className="text-gray-100 pb-5">
                  <i className="fa-solid fa-check px-1 text-[#4CC9F0]" />
                  With real estate asset tokenisation, crypto investors can now
                  easily own a fraction of any given property. Asset
                  tokenisation is the process of converting a physical or
                  digital asset into crypto tokens on the blockchain, and it
                  allows for more efficient management and trading among
                  multiple owners. Crypto tokens representing ownership in a
                  piece of real estate can be bought and sold with crypto and
                  are held securely on the blockchain.
                </li>
                <li className="text-gray-100 pb-5">
                  <i className="fa-solid fa-check px-1 text-[#4CC9F0]" />
                  Asset tokenisation also allows for fractional ownership,
                  meaning that investors can easily own a portion of the
                  physical property without outright purchasing it. This opens
                  up more opportunities for crypto investors to diversify their
                  portfolios, as well as for traditional real estate owners to
                  tap into crypto markets.
                </li>
                <li className="text-gray-100 pb-5">
                  <i className="fa-solid fa-check px-1 text-[#4CC9F0]" />
                  With crypto investors now able to directly own a part of any
                  property they desire, the crypto investment landscape looks
                  set to benefit immensely from this new form of digital
                  ownership. While crypto asset tokenisation is still in its
                  early stages, we can expect to see more real estate tokenised
                  in the future. This will open up a whole new set of
                  opportunities for crypto investors and could revolutionise the
                  way we own and trade real estate.
